# Explorer Total-Body Anonymization

This repository demonstrates the basic functionality to anonymize total-body images generated by the uEXPLORER PET scanner. For sample images, please refer to the TCIA UC Davis uEXPLORER healthy subject data set. All functionality is implemented in face.py, and a demonstration of the anonymization workflow is presented in the Jupyter notebook.

Relevant citations will be provided shortly.
